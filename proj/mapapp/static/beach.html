It is located next to the southern tip of the Marina Beach,[1] and was named after Edward Elliot, a chief magistrate and superintendent of police of the Madras Presidency in colonial India.[2] It has the Shrine of Our Lady of Good Health—also known as Annai Vailankanni Church—on its shore, and the Ashtalakshmi Temple nearby.</p>
